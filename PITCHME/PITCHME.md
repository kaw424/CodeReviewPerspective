### @fa[comment] How About a User Quote? @fa[comment]

---

> “The Open Course Hub was **easy to set up** and get running and my students loved having a one-stop place to go to for their course content. I really love that it **syncs with GitHub so easily** and seamlessly. I was able to have an open, collaborative, **easily updatable**, fully version-controlled site up and running in little time, with fairly modest technical skills. On the student side, it is all beautiful and easy to use on any device!”<br>
— Mark Coster (Associate Professor at Griffith University, Australia)

### Problems the Course Hub Tackles

@ul[squares]

- Pedagogical goals that are unmet by the current LMS
- Student and facilitator experiences, especially multi-device, are below expectations
- Unable to leverage existing Web authoring skills or standards on the current Learning
- Ability to access, share and collaboratively edit course materials is lacking
- The creation and updating of online materials is too time consuming
- Online course materials are difficult to repurpose
